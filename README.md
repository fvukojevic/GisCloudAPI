# How to set up local development environment (macOS) #  
  
- Install docker [Link](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)  
- Install docker-compose ```brew install docker-compose```  
- Click on Docker whale icon, open Preferences, Resources, File Sharing. With + button add project folder to Docker resources, and press Apply & Restart.  
  
# How to set up local development environment (Windows) #  
- Install docker for Windows [Link]([https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/])  
- Install cygwin [Link](https://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe)  
- During cygwin setup follow these steps:  
  1. When asked "Choose a download source", select "Install from Internet"  
  2. Install for All Users  
  3. Choose default selections on next steps  
  4. Choose first download site from list  
  5. On Select Packages screen, under View choose Not Installed, scroll down and find make package.   
    Double click on Skip under New column, and latest version would be selected. Click Next.  
  6. On review and confirm changes, click Next.  
- Double click on cygwin icon and open terminal. Disk "C" is mapped under /cygdrive/c and if you want to go inside project   
folder which is placed i.e. on Desktop of User Windows user, type `cd /cygdrive/c/User/Desktop/ProjectFolder`.  
From that folder you can manage and use local development environment.

# Step 2: 

- Go inside project folder and issue command ```make build```. It will build docker images for this project.

# Step 3:
- After images are built, you can start your environment. Command for that is
 ```make start```

# Step 4:
- After all containers are up (no additional docker output is thrown in console), open another terminal session.   
    Go to project folder and issue command ```make setup``` which will execute   
    post-install steps like updating hosts file, executing migrations, etc.
    Notice that you might be asked for your root password in order to insert host entries to /etc/hosts.

- Execute command ```make stop``` when you want to stop your development environment. 
- In case you need clean environment, execute ```make clean``` which will remove all containers and allow you to run the new clean development environment with ```make start```. 
- Application is accessible via http://backend

# Step 5:
- Open http://backend/api/documentation where you can test api provided by swagger

# Step 6:
- If you want to rebuild db for whatever reason use the ```make migrations``` command. It will clean everything and run initial seeders

# Useful Laravel commands (not necessary if everything above went well):
```
php artisan key:generate (in .env populates APP_KEY variable)
php artisan migrate (runs all migrations) 
php artisan db:seed (seeds data)
php artisan serve (runs local env)
```
